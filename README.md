# OLA_Analysis

###  📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes OLA ride data to extract meaningful insights related to ride trends, pricing, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. The goal is to leverage data analytics techniques to identify patterns, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance user experience.

###  📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains ride details, including:

   1. Ride ID: Unique identifier for each ride

   2. Pickup & Drop-off Locations: Geographical details of the ride

   3. Ride Duration: Time taken for each trip

   4. Fare Amount: Cost of each ride

   5. Distance Covered: Total distance traveled

   6. Ride Type: Categories like Mini, Micro, Prime, etc.

   7. Date & Time: Timestamp of rides

   8. Surge Pricing Indicator: Whether surge pricing was applied

###  🛠️ Tools & Technologies

The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

   1. Programming Languages: Python

   2. Data Manipulation & Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

   3. Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

   4. Database: PostgreSQL 

   5. Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for predictive analytics)

### 📊 Key Insights & Findings

   1. Peak Ride Hours: Identified peak hours when ride demand is highest.

   2. Price Fluctuations: Analysis of fare variation based on time of day and demand.
  
   3. Ride Type Preferences: Popularity of different ride types across locations.

   4. Impact of Surge Pricing: How surge pricing affects customer demand and ride completion rates.

   5. Distance vs Fare Analysis: Correlation between ride distance and fare charged.
